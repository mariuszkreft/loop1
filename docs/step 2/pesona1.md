Emotional & Cognitive State: Her current emotional state fluctuates with daily demands.

She values success celebration style that involves private reflection and sharing with a close-knit group.
Social Behavior: Elara has moderate social sharing comfort, preferring to share intimate successes with a small, trusted circle. Her support system strength is solid, built around a few close friends and her partner, but she identifies support system gaps in professional mentorship and practical help with household tasks.
