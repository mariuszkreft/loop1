This image displays two interconnected diagrams, both related to a system architecture and a feedback loop, likely for a personalized recommendation or intervention system.

**Left Diagram: Ontology -- Givets Feedback Loop**

This diagram illustrates a continuous learning loop centered around user interaction and an "Ontology."

*   **User Ontology:** Represents knowledge about the user.
*   **User Interaction:** The core of the loop, where the user engages with the system.
*   **GIVETS Database:** Likely stores various "givets" or interventions to be offered.

The loop flows as follows:

1.  **Initial Questions:** The process starts with questions, likely to gather initial user information.
2.  **Persona Building / Ontology Creation:** Based on initial data, a user persona and ontology are built.
3.  **Ontology Refinement:** The ontology is continuously refined.
4.  **Deep User Understanding:** This stage involves gaining a deeper understanding of the user.
5.  **Persona Selection / Intervention Selection:** Based on the persona and understanding, relevant interventions ("givets") are selected.
6.  **Delivery & Tracking:** The selected intervention is delivered, and its impact is tracked.
7.  **Feedback Loop:** User feedback and outcome data are collected.
8.  **Continuous Learning Loop:** This feedback drives further ontology refinement and deeper user understanding, completing the loop.

The key questions driving this loop are highlighted at the bottom: "Build Ontology - Select Interventions - Track Results - Refine Understanding - Better Interventions." The goal is to gain more understanding, leading to better interventions.

**Right Diagram: Architecture**

This diagram provides a more detailed architectural view of a system, likely the implementation of the feedback loop described on the left.

*   **Persona Ontology:** This box, highlighted in pink, defines the user's characteristics:
    1.  Traits (stables)
    2.  Situational traits
    3.  Behaviors
    4.  Goals
    5.  Context
    *   An arrow points from "Persona Ontology" to "Build and enhance the persona ontology."

*   **Inspiration Library:** Another pink box, labeled "Inspiration Library (Database with Metaphoric)," suggests a collection of ideas or content to inspire users.
    *   A question above it asks: "Question: how we keep building the inspiration library???"

*   **Match:** There's a "match" stage between the "Persona Ontology" and "Inspiration Library," implying that user profiles are matched with relevant inspirations.

The flow of the system:

1.  **Diagnostic Strategies / Extraction and conclusion about the state of the user (using LLM reasoning):** This initial step uses reasoning, potentially Large Language Models (LLMs), to understand the user's state.
2.  **Build and enhance the persona ontology:** Based on diagnostics, the persona ontology is updated.
3.  **Pick an inspiration:** An inspiration is selected from the library, likely based on the persona-inspiration match.
4.  **User interacts with the inspiration:** The user engages with the chosen inspiration.
5.  **Track user behaviour and measure user feedback on interventions and changes in states:** User interactions and feedback are monitored.

Several other components and processes are also shown:

*   **Action measure (e.g., question) or passive inference from user interaction:** This feeds into the diagnostic strategies.
*   **Predictive Validation (running experiments for Confirmative and opposing inspirations and check predictive validity):** This process evaluates the effectiveness of inspirations.
*   **Analyze:** This section lists analytical tasks:
    1.  Psychometric Quality of Diagnostics tools and strategy
    2.  Validation user model
    3.  Learning loop for Inspiration library
    *   An arrow from "Analyze" points back to the "Inspiration Library" question, indicating that analysis helps refine the library.

In essence, both diagrams describe a sophisticated, AI-driven system that personalizes content or interventions by building a deep understanding of the user (persona ontology), matching it with relevant resources (inspiration library), tracking interactions, and continuously learning from feedback to improve its effectiveness. The right diagram specifically highlights the use of LLMs for diagnostics and includes a predictive validation step.
