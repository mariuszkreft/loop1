A continuously growing intervention library powered by GenAI can be designed as a semi-automated pipeline where human expertise, evidence standards, and AI creativity work together. Hereâ€™s a structured way to think about it:
1. Foundation: Core Intervention Library
Seed library: Start with validated, evidence-based interventions (MBSR, CBT, ACT, positive psychology, motivational interviewing, etc.).
Metadata tagging: Each intervention is tagged with:
Goal/outcome (reduce stress, boost focus, enhance self-compassion, etc.)
User fit (values alignment, learning style, time requirement, energy level, etc.)
Format (text, audio, micro-practice, journaling prompt, ritual, etc.)
Evaluation evidence (RCT-based, clinical, expert consensus, or experimental).
This becomes your gold standard backbone.
2. Continuous Expansion with GenAI
Idea generation: Use GenAI to propose variations of existing interventions (shorter versions, playful framing, new metaphors, culturally adapted versions).
Novel synthesis: Generate new micro-interventions by combining elements across domains (e.g., a mindfulness breathing exercise blended with a creative writing prompt).
Contextual adaptation: Dynamically tailor interventions to user context (time of day, emotional state, available energy).
